                    <h2>Manjaro</h2>
                    <p>Manjaro is an accessible, friendly, and open-source operating system. Providing all the benefits
                        of cutting-edge software combined with a focus on getting started quickly, automated tools to
                        require less manual intervention, and help readily available when needed, Manjaro is suitable
                        for both newcomers and experienced computer users.</p>
                    <p>Unlike proprietary operating systems you have full control over your hardware without
                        restrictions. This makes Manjaro a powerful Operating System ideal in home, work, and
                        development environments.</p>
                    <p>It is easily possible to run many popular Windows applications using compatibility software such
                        as Wine, PlayonLinux or Proton via Steam. The examples given here are far from comprehensive!
                    </p>
                    <p>Manjaro represents a perfect middle-ground for those who want good performance, full control, and
                        cutting-edge software but also a degree of software stability. </p>

                    <p>Manjaro will always be completely free. We create it, so we can have a operating system that is
                        easy to use and stable. You, the user, are the main focus. We do not take control away from you
                        and respect your privacy.</p>

                        compatible equivalents of popular Windows software such as MS Office. Any additional software is
                        also completely free. Searching for applications to install on the internet is not necessary.
